# UX Engineering Lab

This project is a laboratory for experiments in UX Engineering (UXE). Here, we explore innovative practices, tools, and approaches to enhance user experience through interface engineering. The goal is to test ideas, validate hypotheses, and share insights about design, usability, and front-end development.

## Exploratory Ideas

This section highlights ongoing and potential experiments within the lab. Each idea aims to push the boundaries of user experience by applying novel techniques, prototyping new interactions, or evaluating emerging technologies. We also focus on understanding the best performance and structure of key elements in web portals and products, ensuring that the solutions are both innovative and efficient.
