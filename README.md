# UX Engineering Lab

This project is a laboratory for experiments in UX Engineering (UXE). Here, we explore innovative practices, tools, and approaches to enhance user experience through interface engineering. The goal is to test ideas, validate hypotheses, and share insights about design, usability, and front-end development.

## Identity - Fail Digital

- Subtlety in flaws (textures, noise, subtle imperfections)
- Fusion between the organic and the digital
- Contemporary, ethereal palette with emotional contrast
- Typography that suggests both rationality and artistic expression

### Considered Fonts

Considering the balance between artistic expressiveness and digital structure, my suggestion is:

- Titles and highlights: 'Space Grotesk' – geometric and experimental
- Body text and UI: 'Inter' or 'IBM Plex Sans' – clean and versatile
- Monospace (for technical elements or code): 'Fira Code'

### Considered Palette

| Name              | Hex       | Function                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Soft Fail**     | `#e5e5e6` | Backgrounds, empty "white" spaces    |
| **Live Error**    | `#ff4c4c` | Accents, highlights, "poetic alerts" |
| **Blind Pixel**   | `#0d0d0d` | Primary typography, depth            |
| **Blue Noise**    | `#577fff` | Links, hover, soft digitality        |
| **Glitch Gray**   | `#777777` | Neutral elements, wireframes         |
| **Lavender Loop** | `#c8b3ec` | Creativity, art, transcendence       |

## Exploratory Ideas

This section highlights ongoing and potential experiments within the lab. Each idea aims to push the boundaries of user experience by applying novel techniques, prototyping new interactions, or evaluating emerging technologies. We also focus on understanding the best performance and structure of key elements in web portals and products, ensuring that the solutions are both innovative and efficient.
